# Database Seed Scripts

This directory contains scripts for seeding the database with initial data.

## BPDS Seed Script

The `seed.ts` script populates the database with the Blueprint Diagnostic Screener (BPDS) assessment.

### Running the Script

To run the seed script, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd apps/server

# Run the seed script (this will build the project and run the script)
npm run seed
```

Alternatively, you can run the script manually:

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd apps/server

# Compile the TypeScript files
npm run build

# Run the seed script
tsx ./scripts/seed.ts
```

### Notes

- The script requires a valid PostgreSQL connection string in the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable.
- The assessment ID in the original payload was "abcd-123", but the database schema uses a serial primary key, so the ID will be automatically generated by the database.
- The script assigns appropriate domains to each question based on their content:
  - Depression: Questions about interest/pleasure and feeling down
  - Mania: Questions about sleeping less and starting more projects
  - Anxiety: Questions about feeling nervous, panic, and avoiding situations
  - Substance Use: Questions about drinking alcohol
